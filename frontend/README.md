# Frontend React Application

This is the frontend part of the React-Flask application. It is built using React and serves as the user interface for the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-flask-app/frontend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Folder Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the React application.
  - `App.jsx`: The main component that manages the application state and renders child components.
  - `index.jsx`: The entry point for the React application, rendering the `App` component into the DOM.
  
- `public/`: Contains static files.
  - `index.html`: The main HTML file that serves the React application.

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:
```
npm run build
```
This will generate a `build` folder with optimized files for deployment.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests if you have suggestions or improvements for the frontend application.
